Copy as RTF TextMate bundle
===========================

Need to copy + paste some text and _keep_ the syntax highlighting?

Yes you do. All the time. For Keynote presentations. And probably other reasons.

Install this bundle, and after selecting some pretty syntax highlighted text,
use `⌃⌥⌘R` to copy it as RTF (rich text format) Now you can 
paste it directly into Keynote presentations. And other places where RTF is supported.


Installation
============

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Pristine\ Copy/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Pristine\ Copy/Bundles
    git clone git://github.com/aharpole/copy-as-rtf-tmbundle.git "Copy as RTF.tmbundle"
    
Inside TextMate, click "Reload Bundles."

This bundle was created by [Max Muermann](http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/8530-max-muermann)

I have modified it to work (probably exclusively) with TextMate 2. This version lives on my [GitHub profile](http://github.com/aharpole/copy-as-rtf-tmbundle)
