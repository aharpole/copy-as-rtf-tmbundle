Copy as RTF TextMate bundle
===========================

Need to copy + paste some text and _keep_ the syntax highlighting?

Yes you do. All the time. Maybe you're making a Keynote presentation. Maybe you want to file it away in Evernote and keep it beautiful.

Install this bundle, and after selecting some pretty syntax highlighted text,
use `⌃⌥⌘R` to copy it as RTF (rich text format) Now you can 
paste it directly into Keynote presentations. And other places where RTF is supported.
